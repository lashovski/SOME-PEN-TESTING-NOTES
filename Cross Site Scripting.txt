CROSS SITE SCRIPTING: (WE USE METASPLOITABLE2 VM HERE) (IT HAS IT'S OWN WEBSITES)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into trusted websites, which are then executed in the victim's browser.

HOW TO TEST FOR  VULNERABILITIES:
	In the typing field we can enter a script to create a simple alert and after 
	submitting the information in the field it shoud pop up like an alert

SCRIPT IN THE FIELD (EXAMPLE ALERT)
	<script>alert("i hacked you!")</script> 
	(KNOWN ALSO LIKE "REFLECTED XSS")

STORED SCRIPT:
	The same thing here; After injecting the script it can be stored for example in a 	comment page of the website and after somebody opens this injected commend the script 	alert message will appear for him "i hacked you!" 
	(KNOWN ALSO LIKE "STORED XSS")


EXAMPLE ATTACK USING "BEEF"

1.) Open beef and wait for the browser appearing and login
2.) Get the "Example" from the beef starting terminal and copy it!
3.) Go to the metasploitable2 website and try injecting the url in some message box (If there is a limit for the 	simbols inside the box use "inspect" and overwrite the code field to bypass it
4.) Then submit the "comment" or "message" and go back to beef (NOW YOU ARE READY AND EVERY TIME THE VICTIM GOES TO 	THIS MESSAGE IT WILL BE HOOCKED!
